# Coffee Logging Web Application (current work in progress)

## Purpose

Created a method of collecting information on coffee and their associated recipes (from here on referred to as "Dials"). Users are able to record details based on provided information from the roaster that it was purchased from. Dials can be created based on the temperature, weight, grind setting, time, and yield. In addition, Users will be able to share coffees and dials with one another to try out for themselves. They will be able to rate and comment on what others have recorded.

## How This Came About

I have worked in the coffee industry for nearly 17 years. During my time, dials were a key tool for providing consistent quality coffee drinks. However, they would normally be written in notebooks or on loose sheets of paper which would both get damaged or lost. This had happened at every single cafe and roastery I had been employed with. As a result, staff members would have to start over the entire dialing process from scratch, which interrupts workflow and is an inefficient use of time. A coffee dials logger is a solution for this issue.

In many modern cafes, a tablet is used to track order tickets, so why not compliment that with a dials logger!
